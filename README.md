## Overview

A tic-tac-toe game written in Vanilla Javascript and SCSS, that is either two player or against the computer.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person (same computer)

## My process

Build Test, build test, build test. Starting with mobile layout first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- SCSS

### What I learned

Why some people prefer to use frameworks like react or Vue. Throughout the game.js file I had trouble keeping DOM manipulation from not showing up kind of everywhere, with a framework I suspect it would be alot more organized.

### Continued development

If I had to do this project again I would make more use of getters and setters for the main game object. Where the getters or setter would change the DOM as the game state is updated. Or, I would use a front end framework. All in all this was good practice for vanilla JS.

I'd possibly make a better AI for the game, as of right now the AI is random.

Another option is to write a backend for the game.

Adding css animations/transitions.

If I were going to use a framework like React id make use of React Transition Group, this would be easier than writing transitions from scratch in CSS/JS.
